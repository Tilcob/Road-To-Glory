# Raw Assets

This directory contains the **source assets** for **Road-To-Glory** before they are exported or processed. The contents are not necessarily runnable in-game and instead serve as working material.

## Structure

- `objects/`: raw files for objects (e.g. PSD, Aseprite, source atlases).
- `ui/`: source graphics and layout files for the user interface.
